# Sweater Weather

https://github.com/antoniojking/sweater_weather


## Project Description
Sweater Weather is an api application, designed with planning road trips in mind. Frontend developers can access the provided endpoints to create weather forecast dashboards, registration and login forms for users, as well as display details for a users next road trip. Additionally, this app will allow users to see the current weather as well as the forecasted weather at the destination when given location parameters.

## Learning Goals
- Expose an API that aggregates data from multiple external APIs
- Expose an API that requires an authentication token
- Expose an API for CRUD functionality
- Determine completion criteria based on the needs of other developers
- Research, select, and consume an API based on your needs as a developer
